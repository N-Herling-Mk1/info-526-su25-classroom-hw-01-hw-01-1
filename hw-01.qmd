## 1 - Road traffic accidents in Edinburgh

<div style="background-color:#f0f0f0; padding:10px; border-radius:5px; border:1px solid #87CEEB;">

This plot visualizes the distribution of road accidents across different times of the day, separated by weekend and weekday. The data is faceted by whether the day is a weekend or not, making it easy to compare patterns across these two categories. Accident severity is color-coded to distinguish between fatal, serious, and slight incidents. The plot reveals time-based trends that may help identify peak periods of high-risk activity. This information could support planning for improved traffic safety or emergency response allocation.

**Question 2a**

**Histograms show:**<br>
- **Shape of the distribution:** The histogram reveals whether the distribution is symmetric, skewed (e.g., right-skewed), or multimodal.<br>
- **Modes (peaks):** You can visually detect one or more peaks in the data.<br>
- **Density & Spread:** It shows how densely packed the finish times are in different ranges.<br>
- **Granularity:** Depending on bin width, you get a more detailed look at frequency in specific intervals.<br>

**Box plots show:**<br>
- **Median:** Clearly marks the central tendency with a horizontal line inside the box.<br>
- **Quartiles:** The interquartile range (IQR) is explicitly visible, showing where the middle 50% of data lies.<br>
- **Outliers:** Easily identifies extreme finish times beyond 1.5Ã—IQR from the quartiles.<br>
- **Range and spread:** Gives a concise summary of the minimum, maximum (excluding outliers), and variability.<br>

## 3 - US counties
<div style="background-color:#f0f0f0; padding:10px; border-radius:5px; border:1px solid #87CEEB;">

**Question 3a**<br>
This code attempts to make two differenlty dimensioned plots overlay one another.
 <pre style="white-space:pre-wrap; line-height:1;"><code>
ggplot(county) +
  geom_point(aes(x = median_edu, y = median_hh_income)) +
  </code></pre>
  
  The first line - Creates a geom_point or scatter plot with median_edv vs. median_hh_income.
 <pre style="border:1px solid #4A4A4A; padding:5px;"><code>
ggplot(county) +
  geom_point(aes(x = median_edu, y = median_hh_income)) +
  </code></pre>

The second line - Creates a boxplot with smoking_ban and pop2017 as its parameters.
 <pre style="border:1px solid #4A4A4A; padding:5px;"><code>
ggplot(county) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(x = smoking_ban, y = pop2017))
  </code></pre>


Both geom_point and geom_boxplot are layered in the same ggplot, but they rely on different x and y variables. On their own, each layer would produce a meaningful plot, but combined, they result in a confusing and misleading visualizationâ€”a kind of visual cacophony.

Technically, the code may run without error, but it doesn't "work" from a data visualization standpoint. Mixing different aesthetics (continuous vs. categorical x-axes) in one plot without coordinating scales or structure leads to a plot that is hard to interpret and potentially misleading.
</div>

<div style="background-color:#f0f0f0; padding:10px; border-radius:5px; border:1px solid #87CEEB;">

**Question 3b**<br>
We are to compare two graphs, each showing the same data but presented differently.
<img src="images/county-facets-1.png" alt="County facets plot" style="width:100%; max-width:300px;" />
<img src="images/county-facets-2.png" alt="County facets plot" style="width:100%; max-width:300px;" />

An obvious answer is the left graph, where the data is plotted horizontally has more visual
striking power.
Yet, if we look at how the data is grouped on the vertical (right) graph we see some 
skewing of the data geometry represented in the left graph.

Therefore, from these two graphs we cannot conclude that 'in general' graphing
data such as this horizontally will yield better visual results. To truly make
a comparison the vertical graph would need to be stretched out to the same dimension/scale 
as the horizontal graph.

**Question 4a**<br>
<b>Describe the relationship between income and credit card balance. Touch on how/if the relationship varies based on the four (4) category combinations.</b><br>
The relationship between income and credit card balance is clearly increasingâ€”higher income tends to correspond with higher balances. This positive trend holds across all categories examined. Notably, the slope of the trend lines is nearly identical when comparing non-married students to non-married non-students, and a similar pattern is seen when comparing married students to married non-students.

However it should be noted that all distributions examined are skewed towards the left end of the wage scale.

This suggests that while income strongly influences credit card balance, the effect of student or marital status on that relationship is minimal. The key takeaway is that income is the dominant factor, with student and marital status having little impact on the strength of that relationship.

**Question 4b**<br>
<b>Based on your answer to part (a), do you think married and student might be useful predictors, in addition to income for predicting credit card balance? Explain your reasoning.</b><br>
Yes, although it's important to note that there are many zero outliers to consider. While income appears to be a key factor, it's also important to recognize that, overall, the data for individuals who are both married and students shows a positively increasing trend when comparing income to credit card balance.

**Question 4d**
<br><b>Based on the plot from part (c), how, if at all, are the relationships between income and credit utilization different than the relationships between income and credit balance for individuals with various student and marriage status.</b><br>
The relationships between income and credit utilization now differ more distinctly across the four categories compared to the overall positive trends observed in part (c) with credit balance. Specifically, there is a positive relationship between income and credit utilization for both married and non-married non-students. In contrast, non-married students show a strong negative relationship, which may partly be influenced by the geometry or distribution of the dataset. For married students, the relationship is only slightly negative. Overall, these differences highlight that the patterns seen in credit utilization are not as uniformly positive as those in credit balance, and they vary more noticeably by student and marital status.

<b>Part b</b><br>
I added extra code comments with '#<----- ' in the code for this problem, to add extra description(s)/proof of knowledge of code functionality.
<br><b>Part c</b><br>
For my individualization, I forced the city names to 'non overlap' and changed their color to a hue that was legible on both white and brown backgrounds. [#00CED1]
